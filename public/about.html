<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Amarnath, a third-year Computer Science Engineering student at Malla
Reddy University in Kompally, while my hometown is Patancheru. With an
aspiration to become a Software Engineer, I've already mastered Core Java.
Currently, I'm immersed in learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and
I'm also engaged in an exciting web development bootcamp.</p>

<p>Alongside, I'm actively participating in a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) bootcamp to widen my skill set. Over the
upcoming two years, I'm committed to further refining my software development
skills. I'm fascinated by technology and committed to learning to stay updated
in this ever-changing field.</p>
